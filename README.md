# Linear Regression on Housing Data

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of simple multiple linear regression to predict housing prices using Python. The task uses the `housing.csv` dataset with features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking.

## Dataset
- `housing.csv`: Contains the features and target price.
- Columns: 
  - area (int)
  - bedrooms (int)
  - bathrooms (int)
  - stories (int)
  - parking (int)
  - price (int) - target

## Code
- The Python script `task3.py`:
  - Loads and inspects the dataset.
  - Splits data into training and testing subsets.
  - Trains a linear regression model.
  - Evaluates the model with MAE, MSE, and R2 score.
  - Visualizes actual vs predicted prices.

## Usage
1. Place `housing.csv` and `task3.py` together in a folder.
2. Install required Python packages:
